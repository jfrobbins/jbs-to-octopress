jbs-to-octopress
=============

Python script to convert JBS blog posts into Octopress-friendly format


example syntax:
python2 jbs-to-octopress.py /path/to/jbs/articles/

This is a simple file-conversion script. Some sample files are in ./sample_files/ 
The jbs and octopress files are very similar, so the conversion is straight forward.

This in conjunction with the wordpress xml-to-jbs converter (purebasic), one could switch from wordpress to octopress--though that would be a very roundabout way, and I'm sure there are better and more direct ways of doing it.
