I've mentioned this on <a href="https://plus.google.com/107859421704875909999/posts/1o7TrEhzwcG">the Google+</a>, but my brother let me have a laptop computer.  It's a bit old, and I'm not even 100% sure that it works.
It is a Toshiba A205-S5812 Satellite-- Some dual-core Pentium (or core2duo) CPU with 2 GB of DDR2.  Off the top of my head I can't remember anymore of the specs.

I didn't have a charger for it, so I ordered a charger which should be here today. My plan is to go through a bunch of distros and use each for a couple of weeks or so and see how I like them.
Some of them I have used before, many of them I have not.

Here's the list of ISOs that I have accumulated thus far:
<ul>
	<li>FreeBSD</li>
	<li>openSUSE (KDE/LXDE/XFCE)</li>
	<li>Archbang</li>
	<li>Arch Linux</li>
	<li>Crunchbang</li>
	<li>dragonfly BSD</li>
	<li>GhostBSD</li>
	<li>Linux Mint XFCE</li>
	<li>lupu-528 ?  I don't remember what this is, but that's the iso name</li>
	<li>Pardus</li>
	<li>Sabayon (KDE/LXDE/XFCE)</li>
</ul>

I typically prefer LXDE or Openbox (I'm using crunchbang right now), but I look forward to giving all of these a go.

Hopefully I can start tonight!
